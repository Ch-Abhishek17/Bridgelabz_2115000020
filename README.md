Day-8  
- 31-Jan-2025  
- Topics:  
  - Procedural vs Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) – Procedural programming focuses on functions and procedures to perform tasks, while OOP organizes code around objects and       
    classes, encouraging reusability, inheritance, and encapsulation.
  - Class and Object – A class defines the blueprint for creating objects, and an object is an instance of that class, used to represent real-world entities with properties and 
    methods, encapsulating behavior and data.

---

Day-9  
- 02-Feb-2025  
- Topics:  
  - Java Constructors – A constructor in Java is a special method used to initialize objects when they are created. It has the same name as the class and can be overloaded to allow 
    different ways of initializing objects.
  - Instance vs. Class Variables – Instance variables are tied to a specific object and are created when the object is instantiated. Class variables are shared among all instances       of a class, defined using the static keyword, and are created when the class is loaded.
  - Access Modifiers – Access modifiers in Java (e.g., public, private, protected) control the visibility and accessibility of classes, methods, and variables. They determine which 
    other classes can access or modify a given member. 

---

Day-10  
- 04-Feb-2025  
- Topics:  
  - Efficient Memory Usage with Static – Use static for shared values and utility methods to reduce memory usage and avoid redundancy. Static variables belong to the class rather        than any instance, making them ideal for constants and counters.
  - Avoiding Ambiguity with This – Leverage this to reference the current instance and avoid ambiguity when initializing attributes. It helps differentiate between instance              variables and parameters with the same name.
  - Ensuring Immutability with Final – Declare final variables for identifiers or constants that should remain unchanged. The final keyword prevents modification, ensuring data          integrity.
  - Safe Type Checking with Instanceof – Use instanceof for safe type-checking and to prevent runtime errors during typecasting. This ensures that an object is of a specific type        before performing operations on it.
  - Practice Problems – [Bank Account System, Library Management System, Employee Management System, Shopping Cart System, University Student Management, Vehicle Registration System, Hospital Management System ]

*Day-11*  
- *06-Feb-2025*  
- *Topics:*  
  - Object-Oriented Design Principles – focus on structuring software using objects, promoting modularity, reusability, and maintainability through concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. 
  - Class Diagram – Visual representation of system structure and relationships.  
  - Object Diagrams – Showcases the real-world state of objects and their links.  
  - Sequence Diagrams and Object Modeling – It's a UML diagram that illustrates the interaction between objects in a system over time, showing the sequence of messages exchanged.

*Day-12*  
- *07-Feb-2025*  
- *Topics:*  
  - Single-Level and Multilevel Inheritance – Enables a class to inherit properties and methods from a parent class, with multilevel inheritance extending this chain further.
  - Method Overriding – Allows a subclass to redefine a method from its parent class, enabling runtime polymorphism.
  - Constructor Inheritance – While constructors are not inherited, a subclass can invoke the parent class constructor using super().

*Day-13*  
- *10-Feb-2025*  
- *Topics:*  
  - Encapsulation – Use private access modifiers for fields, provide public getters/setters, validate data in setters, and follow naming conventions for methods (e.g., getX, setX).
  - Polymorphism – Program to interfaces, ensure overridden methods follow the base class contract, avoid explicit casting, and keep inheritance hierarchies simple.
  - Interfaces – Use interfaces to define contracts, prefer default methods when needed, and favor composition over inheritance for combining behaviors.
  - Abstract Classes – Use abstract classes for shared state/functionality and combine them with interfaces to separate behavior from implementation.

  - Double Linked List – A data structure where each node contains a data element, a reference to the next node, and a reference to the previous node, allowing traversal in both         directions.
  - Circular Linked List – A variation of a linked list where the last node's next pointer points back to the first node, creating a loop, allowing continuous traversal of the list.

  - Queue – A FIFO (First In, First Out) data structure where elements are added at the rear and removed from the front (e.g., enqueue() and dequeue() operations).
  - HashMap – A key-value data structure that allows O(1) average time for insertions, deletions, and lookups using hashing, with collision handling (e.g., separate chaining).
